🐬 MySQL Beginner Cheat Sheet

A quick reference guide for common SQL commands, tailored for MySQL Workbench users.

🗂️ 1. Database Management

Commands to manage the database container itself.

-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE my_school;

-- Select the database to use (Do this first!)
USE my_school;

-- Delete a database (WARNING: Deletes everything inside)
DROP DATABASE my_school;


🏗️ 2. Table Management (DDL)

Commands to build and modify the structure of your tables.

Create a Table

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    enrolled_date DATETIME
);


Modify a Table

-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE students 
ADD birthdate DATE;

-- Delete a column
ALTER TABLE students 
DROP COLUMN email;

-- Change a column's data type
ALTER TABLE students 
MODIFY COLUMN first_name VARCHAR(100);


Delete/Clear a Table

-- Option 1: Clear all data but KEEP the table (Resets IDs)
TRUNCATE TABLE students;

-- Option 2: Delete the ENTIRE table (Structure + Data)
DROP TABLE students;


📝 3. Data Management (DML)

Commands to Add, Edit, and Remove the actual data.

Insert Data (Create)

-- Insert a row with specific values
INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, enrolled_date)
VALUES (1, 'Spongebob', 'Squarepants', '2025-01-01 10:00:00');

-- Insert a row using "NOW()" for the current time
INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, enrolled_date)
VALUES (2, 'Patrick', 'Star', NOW());


Update Data (Edit)

-- Update a specific student's name
UPDATE students
SET first_name = 'Squidward'
WHERE student_id = 2;

-- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always use WHERE, or you will update EVERY row!


Delete Data (Remove)

-- Delete a single row
DELETE FROM students 
WHERE student_id = 1;

-- Delete multiple specific rows
DELETE FROM students 
WHERE student_id IN (1, 2, 3);


🔍 4. Querying Data (DQL)

Commands to find and view your data.

Basic Selects

-- View everything in the table
SELECT * FROM students;

-- View only specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students;


Filtering (The WHERE Clause)

-- Find specific matches
SELECT * FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Spongebob';

-- Find IDs greater than 5
SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id > 5;

-- Find dates after a certain time
SELECT * FROM students WHERE enrolled_date > '2025-01-01';

-- Find rows where a column is empty
SELECT * FROM students WHERE email IS NULL;


Sorting and Limiting

-- Sort by name A-Z (Ascending)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY last_name ASC;

-- Sort by date Newest-Oldest (Descending)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY enrolled_date DESC;

-- Show only the first 5 results
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;


💡 Pro Tips & Common Errors

1. Error Code: 1175 (Safe Update Mode)

If MySQL Workbench refuses to let you Delete or Update, run this command once:

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;


2. Date Formats

DATE: 'YYYY-MM-DD' (e.g., '2025-12-25')

DATETIME: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' (e.g., '2025-12-25 14:30:00')

3. Quotes

Strings (Text): Must use single quotes ('text').

Numbers: No quotes needed (123).
